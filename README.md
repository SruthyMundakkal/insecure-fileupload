# Insecure Design Challenge

## Goal
1. Research cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and find a way to use it in the app.
2. Why did this work?
3. What would you do to prevent this vulnerability?

Feel free to send me an image of the result with an explanation of how and why the attack worked, and what would be a way to prevent this type of attack.
